# StarLinux
A Minimal Linux Live-Based Distribution, rewritten for simplicity, automation, and ease-of-use.

## What is StarLinux?
StarLinux is an idea I had a long time ago, originally to be made as an Ubuntu-Based Remix, but once I found the Minimal Linux Live Project, I saw that due to my understandings of BASH Scripting, I can easily go much further than a remix, and compile my own Linux Distribution. I started this idea with AwlsomeLinux, but as I look back at it now, it's very sloppy with barely any documentation explaining what's happening behind the hood, so I decided to start fresh, and look back at my MLL roots and rewrite a simple compile process once more.
